        <h2 class="fade-in"><i class="fas fa-user"></i> About Me</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p class="fade-in">My journey in web development began with a desire to learn about coding and design.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">At first, I started with basic HTML and CSS, <br> gradually moving on to more advanced topics like JavaScript and responsive design.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">As I progressed, I became more interested in UI/UX design and how it impacts user interactions.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="fade-in">Personally I think it's essential to create designs that not only look good, but also provide a seamless user experience.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">My goal is to combine my technical skills with my design sensibility to create websites and applications that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">In addition to my technical skills, I also enjoy collaborating with others and learning from different perspectives.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">I believe that teamwork and communication are key to successful projects, and I always strive to create an inclusive and positive work environment.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">For me, design is about creating meaningful experiences that resonate with users on a personal level.</p>

    <section id="experiences" class="fas-fa-briefcase">
        <h2 class="fade-in"><i class="fas fa-briefcase"></i> Experiences</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p class="fade-in">Actually, at first I didn't know much about web development and design.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">However, I was determined to learn and improve my skills.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">So I started taking online courses and practicing on my own.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">I started taking online courses and tutorials, learning the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript <br>
        and also some Backend Development languages.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">This started my journey into web development, which was at first on Khan Academy and later expanded to other platforms, such as SoloLearn and Mimo.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">As I gained more knowledge, I began working on small projects to apply what I had learned, such as on Codecademy and Mimo.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">Over time, I built a portfolio of projects, which showcases my skills and creativity.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">There are even experiences which don't have to do with web development, but have helped me to gain valuable skills.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Here are some of my experiences, below:</p>
